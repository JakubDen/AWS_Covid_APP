# Project description

## 1.Creating AWS Account

- Create account at https://aws.amazon.com/console/
- Choose Business
- Authorize your account using the billing card
- Verify account by sms or call
- Choose Basic Plan

## 2.Configuration

- Install Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSC)
- In VSC install Python Extension 
- Download python for Desktop https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-396/
- Install pip to install libraries https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/
- Install Nodejs to configure serverless https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## 3.Create IAM User in AWS
- Search IAM service 
- Click Users
- Click Add users
- Choose your Username
- Select Acces type : Programmatic access
- Choose Attach existing policies directly, select Administrator Access
- Go to Users, Security credentials, Create access key
- Now you generated Access key ID and Secret Access key, which are needed to connect Tableau between Athena


## 4.Serveless
- Install serverless through npm
```
npm install -g serverless
```
- Install serverless plugins
```
serverless plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements
serverless plugin install -n serverless-wsgi
```
## 5.Deploy simple code
- Create New File app.py and paste code :
```
# app.py

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
```
- Create New File serverless.yml (this is a serverless configuration file) :
```
# serverless.yml

service: serverless-flask

plugins:
  - serverless-python-requirements
  - serverless-wsgi

custom:
  wsgi:
    app: app.app
    packRequirements: false
  pythonRequirements:
    dockerizePip: non-linux

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: python3.6
  stage: dev
  region: us-east-1

functions:
  app:
    handler: wsgi.handler
    events:
      - http: ANY /
      - http: 'ANY /{proxy+}'
```
- Create Virtual Environment (venv) and activate it by "activate" file in venv directory
```
$ virtualenv venv --python=python3
$ ./venv/scripts/activate
```
- In venv install requirements used in your code
```
(venv) $ pip install flask
```
- Freeze your pip requirements
```
$ pip freeze | Out-File -Encoding UTF8 requirements.txt
```
Now you created the requirements.txt file, which is needed to deploy your code
- Deploy your resources to AWS by using the command
```
$ serverless deploy
```
If serverless requires Docker, then install it and enable.
- After deploying, click the generated Endpoint and should be displayed text.

```
Hello World!
```

## 6.Deployed Resources
- After clicking a generated endpoint from deployment, resources are created IN :
    - AWS S3, there is a Serverless Deployment Bucket (Deployment storage)
    - AWS Lambda select your deployed Application (app.py)
    - You can see Resources that you have deployed
    ![](Images/LambdaResources.png)
    - Go to AWS Lambda Functions, there is a overview of your function, Your code (Lambda) triggers API to collect the data (Now you triggered "Hello World!")
    ![](Images/LambdaFunction.png)
## 7.Upgrading your code
- Choose your endpoint request API
    - For example I used the endpoint:
    ```
    https://api.coronavirus.data.gov.uk/v1/data
    ```
    From this API documentation https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/developers-guide/main-api
- Create a request, more information about request https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/
```
    data = request.get(ENDPOINT, params=api_params, timeout=10)
```
- Install the requests requirement
```
pip install requests
```
- Create your request Parameters to Specify your data (Params should be located in API documentation)
- Example of Parameters :
```
filters = [
    f"areaType={ areaType }",
    #f"areaName={ areaName }",
    #f"date={ date }",
    #f"areaCode={ areaCode }"
]

structure = {

    "date": "date",
    "name": "areaName",
    "type": "areaType",
    "Cases": "newCasesByPublishDate",
    #"cumulativeCases": "cumCasesByPublishDate",
    "DeathsByMonthOfTest": "newDeaths28DaysByPublishDate",
    "firstDose" : "newPeopleVaccinatedFirstDoseByPublishDate",
    "secondDose" : "newPeopleVaccinatedSecondDoseByPublishDate",
    "hospitalCases": "hospitalCases",
    "Tests": "newTestsByPublishDate",
    #"femaleCases":"femaleCases",
    #"completeVaccinated" : "newPeopleVaccinatedCompleteByPublishDate",
    #"maleCases":"maleCases"
}

api_params = {
    "filters": str.join(";", filters),
    "structure": json.dumps(structure, separators=(",", ":"))
}
```
- Structure - there is a structure of your JSON data 
![](Images/Structure.png)
- Filters - filter the structure to specify your data
    For example use filter:
    ```
    date='2021-06-07'
    f"date={ date }",
    ```
    And Following JSON will be only from this date:
    ![](Images/filter.png)
- Api_Params - Parse the data into json
- Add the following lines to your end of your code to run your project locally
```
if __name__=="__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```
- Click the Green Arrow in Upper Right Corner in VSC (Run Python file in Terminal),
![](Images/local.png)
- CTRL+Click the generated IP and this will be navigate to your website and display your return code
![](Images/IP.png)
- So You don't need to deploy your function to see your results


# Used Resources in project

## Serverless
Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand, taking care of the servers on behalf of their customers. Serverless computing does not hold resources in volatile memory; computing is rather done in short bursts with the results persisted to storage.
## API
API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, youâ€™re using an API.

I used request for this ENDPOINT : 
```
https://api.coronavirus.data.gov.uk/v1/data
```
from this API documentation, link below
https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/developers-guide/main-api
## AWS Glue
AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development.

Use crawler to add tables to database from Data API
## AWS S3
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
## AWS Lambda
Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, code monitoring and logging.
## AWS Athena
Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL.

## AWS IAM
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. IAM is a feature of your AWS account offered at no additional charge.

Go tu Users. Select Add Users Accses type : Programmatic access, Attach exsiting policies directly : Administrator Access
Here u created User to have permissions to work in AWS Cloud
